  # About
  This folder contains all drug codes.
  Each of the folders, in addition to the CSV files for each database, also contains a checklist with information on:
  - who created the list
  - when the list was created
  - what drug names were used in the search to create the list.

To make it easier to give attribution to the people that created each list, you can see who created which list and which institution they are affiliated with in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CodUwAkaCI86A5OCcUM4UECyZ-k2Lr5RLsp-e6wE1WI/edit?usp=sharing).
